"""Resume validation against sprint-status.

This module implements validation of state.yaml against sprint-status.yaml
when resuming the development loop. It's the REVERSE of sync.py - it reads
sprint-status to detect if state.yaml is stale and needs advancement.

Use case:
- Loop crashes or is interrupted
- sprint-status.yaml is manually updated (marking stories/epics done)
- On resume, state.yaml still points to old position
- This module detects the discrepancy and advances state

Architecture:
- sprint-status.yaml is checked as SECONDARY source
- state.yaml remains the authoritative source for crash recovery
- Validation only ADVANCES state (never rolls back)

Public API:
    - ResumeValidationResult: Dataclass with validation outcome
    - validate_resume_state: Main function to check and fix stale state
