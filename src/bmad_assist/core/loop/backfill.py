"""Backfill mode: detect and queue missed/skipped stories.

When --backfill is enabled, after completing the current story the runner
scans for "gap" stories — stories that exist in the epic list but were
never completed and come before the current forward position. These are
queued for execution before normal forward advancement resumes.

Gap stories arise when:
- Sub-stories (3a, 3a-ii, 4b) were not parsed by older regex
- Stories were added to epics after the epic was partially implemented
- Stories were skipped due to parser bugs

Stories with "deferred" status in sprint-status are excluded — they
represent intentionally postponed work.
