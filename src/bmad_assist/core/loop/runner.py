    """Execute the main BMAD development loop.

    Main orchestrator that ties together all phase execution, story transitions,
    and epic transitions. Implements the "fire-and-forget" design where the loop
    runs autonomously until project completion, guardian halt, or signal interrupt.

    The loop:
    - Loads or creates state on startup
    - Executes phases in sequence using execute_phase() from Story 6.2
    - Handles story completion using handle_story_completion() from Story 6.3
    - Handles epic completion using handle_epic_completion() from Story 6.4
    - Saves state after each phase
    - Checks for shutdown signals after each save_state()
    - Continues until project completion, anomaly detection, or signal interrupt

    Args:
        config: Pydantic Config model with state_path, provider settings.
        project_path: Path to project root directory.
        epic_list: Sorted list of epic numbers (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 6]).
            Typically generated via glob docs/epics/epic-*.md → extract numbers → sort.
        epic_stories_loader: Callable that returns story IDs for given epic.
            Takes epic number (int), returns list of story IDs (list[str]).

    Returns:
        LoopExitReason indicating how the loop exited:
        - COMPLETED: Project finished successfully
        - INTERRUPTED_SIGINT: Interrupted by Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
        - INTERRUPTED_SIGTERM: Interrupted by kill signal (SIGTERM)
        - GUARDIAN_HALT: Halted by Guardian for user intervention

    Raises:
        StateError: If epic_list is empty.
        StateError: If first epic has no stories.
        StateError: If state file exists but is corrupted (propagated from load_state).

    Example:
        >>> epic_list = [1, 2, 3]
        >>> loader = lambda epic: [f"{epic}.1", f"{epic}.2", f"{epic}.3"]
        >>> result = run_loop(config, project_path, epic_list, loader)
        >>> result
        <LoopExitReason.COMPLETED: 'completed'>

    Note:
        - Guardian integration is placeholder only (Epic 8)
        - Dashboard update is log placeholder only (Epic 9)
        - Signal handlers (SIGINT/SIGTERM) are registered for graceful shutdown (Story 6.6)
        - NEVER calls sys.exit() - returns LoopExitReason for CLI to handle
