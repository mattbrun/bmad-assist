"""ToolCallGuard — LLM tool call watchdog.

Per-invocation watchdog that observes tool call patterns in provider streams
and terminates sessions when runaway behavior is detected.

Three detection mechanisms:
1. Hard budget cap on total tool calls (default: 300)
2. Per-file interaction cap — read+write+edit combined (default: 40,
   elevated to 2x for files that were budget-trimmed out of the prompt
   context — see ``elevated_file_paths`` below)
3. Sliding-window per-minute rate cap (default: 90/min)

The elevated per-file cap exists because budget-trimmed files don't appear
in the prompt context — the model must read them via tool calls. A flat
cap punishes legitimate use of tools to recover information the prompt
trimmed away.

Thread safety: check() and get_stats() are protected by an internal lock,
safe for concurrent calls from stream-reader and main threads.
