# Changelog

All notable changes to bmad-assist are documented in this file.

## [0.4.12] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- **Flexible Epic Story Parser** with fallback for non-standard formats (thanks @Richard)
  - Parses `PRSP-5-1`, `REFACTOR-2-1` style story headers when standard `## Story X.Y:` not found
  - Status-anchored detection: finds stories by `**Status:**` field presence
  - Sequential numbering (1.1, 1.2, 1.3...) regardless of original IDs
  - New `code` field on `EpicStory` preserves original story codes
  - Mixed heading levels supported (###, ####, #####)
  - Non-standard dependency extraction (`**Dependencies:** PRSP-5-1, PRSP-5-2`)
- **Default patches fallback** for pip-installed users without local BMAD installation (thanks [@mattbrun](https://github.com/mattbrun))
- **GitHub Actions CI** workflow for tests, mypy, and ruff
- **Test health initiative** completed - mutation testing analysis, 73% mutation score achieved

### Fixed
- **Scorecard:** gosec reliability and error handling, eliminate false positives when tools not installed
- **Config validation:** identify specific config file causing errors, include actual validation error in messages
- **Strategic context:** truncate docs instead of skipping when over token budget (thanks [@mattbrun](https://github.com/mattbrun))
- **Mypy:** resolve all type errors, enable strict CI checks
- **CI tests:** Rich/Typer help tests now skip properly in Docker/root environments

### Changed
- `_extract_status()` now cleans trailing asterisks (handles typos like `done**`)
- `_parse_story_sections()` accepts optional `epic_num` and `path` parameters

## [0.4.11] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **Per-phase model configuration** (`phase_models`) - specify different LLM providers/models for each workflow phase
  - Single-LLM phases: object format with `provider`, `model`, `model_name`, `settings`
  - Multi-LLM phases: array format with full control over validator/reviewer list
  - Phases not in `phase_models` fall back to global `providers` config
  - Settings path validation with tilde expansion
- **23 unit tests** for phase_models validation, resolution, and fallback behavior
- **Documentation** for per-phase configuration in `docs/configuration.md`

### Changed
- **Breaking:** When `phase_models` defines a multi-LLM phase (`validate_story`, `code_review`), master is NOT auto-added - user has full control over the list
- When falling back to global `providers.multi` (no phase_models override), master IS still auto-added (existing behavior preserved)

## [0.4.10] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **`bmad-assist test scorecard <fixture>`** command for automated quality scoring of experiment fixtures
  - Completeness: TODOs, placeholders, empty files detection
  - Functionality: build verification, unit tests, behavior tests
  - Code Quality: linting (go vet), complexity (gocyclo), security (gosec)
  - Documentation: README, API docs, inline comments ratio
- **Experiment prerequisites documentation** (`docs/experiments/prerequisites.md`)
- **Benchmark fixtures release** with webhook-relay-001, 002, 003 (available in GitHub Releases)

### Fixed
- **Scorecard false positives** when Go tools not installed - now correctly reports `skipped: true` with reason instead of giving max scores
- Graceful degradation for missing `gocyclo` and `gosec` tools

### Changed
- Scorecard defaults changed from max to 0 for code_quality when tools unavailable

### Benchmark Results
First empirical validation of Antipatterns module effectiveness:

| Fixture | Config | Score | Build | Tests |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| webhook-relay-001 | baseline | 40.0% | FAIL | 252 |
| webhook-relay-002 | strategic context | 28.2% | FAIL | 0 |
| webhook-relay-003 | strategic + antipatterns | **55.3%** | **PASS** | **1254** |

Key findings:
- Strategic context alone caused regression (-11.8pp)
- Antipatterns module improved quality significantly (+15.3pp vs baseline, +27.1pp vs strategic-only)
- 5x more unit tests generated with antipatterns guidance

## [0.4.9] - 2026-01-25

### Changed
- **refactor(config):** Split `config.py` into modular `core/config/` package
- **refactor(providers):** Extract shared helpers, add cross-platform `platform_command.py` (thanks [@mattbrun](https://github.com/mattbrun))
- **refactor(loop):** Split `runner.py` into 5 helper modules
- **refactor(antipatterns):** Replace LLM extraction with deterministic regex

### Fixed
- Full mypy/ruff compliance across 102 files

## [0.4.8] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **Strategic Context Optimization** for workflow compilers - configurable loading of strategic docs (PRD, Architecture, UX, project-context)
  - New `strategic_context` section in bmad-assist.yaml with per-workflow overrides
  - `StrategicContextService` replaces hardcoded document loading
  - Token budget enforcement and `main_only` flag for sharded docs
  - Benchmark analysis showed 0% PRD usage in code-review → excluded by default
  - `create_story`: all docs (prd, architecture, ux, project-context), indexes only
  - `validate_story`: project-context + architecture only
  - `dev_story`, `code_review`, synthesis workflows: project-context only

## [0.4.7] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Cursor Agent provider** for Multi-LLM orchestration (subprocess-based)
  (thanks [@mattbrun](https://github.com/mattbrun))
- **GitHub Copilot provider** for Multi-LLM orchestration (subprocess-based)
  (thanks [@mattbrun](https://github.com/mattbrun))

## [0.4.6] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Evidence Score System** for validation and code review workflows - replaces 1-10 scoring with mathematical model
  - CRITICAL (+3), IMPORTANT (+1), MINOR (+0.3), CLEAN PASS (-0.5)
  - Deterministic verdict thresholds: ≥6 REJECT, 4-6 REWORK, ≤3 READY/APPROVE, ≤-3 EXCELLENT/EXEMPLARY
  - Mandatory evidence enforcement ("no quote, no finding" for stories; "no code snippet, no finding" for code review)
  - Anti-Bias Battery with 5 self-checks (Devil's Advocate, Ego Check, Context Check, Best Intent, Pattern Recognition)
  - Based on Deep Verify methodology by [@LKrysik](https://github.com/LKrysik/BMAD-METHOD) 🎯
- Evidence Score extraction in `validation_metrics.py` with backward compatibility
- New regex patterns for Evidence Score report parsing
- `bmad-assist patch compile-all` command for batch compilation of all patches without valid cache
- Per-phase timeout configuration via `timeouts:` section in bmad-assist.yaml
- Antipatterns extraction from synthesis reports for organizational learning
- Source context support for validation workflows (story file, epic context)
- Auto-generate sprint-status.yaml from epic files when missing

### Fixed
- Python 3.14+ compatibility: `Traversable` import moved to `importlib.resources.abc` (thanks [@mattbrun](https://github.com/mattbrun))
- Clearer error messages for outdated/incompatible cache files
- Evidence Score calculation deduplication in code review reports
- `webhook-relay` experiment fixture repaired (other fixtures still broken)

### Changed
- `validate-story` workflow now uses Evidence Score instead of 1-10 severity
- `validate-story-synthesis` workflow updated for CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/MINOR terminology
- `code-review` workflow now uses Evidence Score with mandatory code snippet enforcement
- `code-review-synthesis` workflow updated for CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/MINOR terminology
- `ValidatorMetrics` dataclass extended with Evidence Score fields
- `AggregateMetrics` with auto-detection of report format (legacy vs Evidence Score)
- `format_deterministic_metrics_header()` dynamically switches output format

- Batch overwrite prompt `[a/s/i/d/?]` when local workflows differ from bundled
- `--reset-workflows` flag for `init` command to restore bundled versions
- `warnings.suppress_gitignore` config option to silence gitignore warnings

### Changed
- `init` command refactored to use shared `ensure_project_setup()` logic
- `run` command now performs implicit project setup (without gitignore changes)
- File copy uses atomic write with rollback on partial failure
