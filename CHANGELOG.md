# Changelog

All notable changes to bmad-assist are documented in this file.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **Strategic Context Optimization** for workflow compilers - configurable loading of strategic docs (PRD, Architecture, UX, project-context)
  - New `strategic_context` section in bmad-assist.yaml with per-workflow overrides
  - `StrategicContextService` replaces hardcoded document loading
  - Token budget enforcement and `main_only` flag for sharded docs
  - Benchmark analysis showed 0% PRD usage in code-review → excluded by default
  - `create_story`: all docs (prd, architecture, ux, project-context), indexes only
  - `validate_story`: project-context + architecture only
  - `dev_story`, `code_review`, synthesis workflows: project-context only

## [0.4.7] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Cursor Agent provider** for Multi-LLM orchestration (subprocess-based)
- **GitHub Copilot provider** for Multi-LLM orchestration (subprocess-based)

## [0.4.6] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- **Evidence Score System** for validation and code review workflows - replaces 1-10 scoring with mathematical model
  - CRITICAL (+3), IMPORTANT (+1), MINOR (+0.3), CLEAN PASS (-0.5)
  - Deterministic verdict thresholds: ≥6 REJECT, 4-6 REWORK, ≤3 READY/APPROVE, ≤-3 EXCELLENT/EXEMPLARY
  - Mandatory evidence enforcement ("no quote, no finding" for stories; "no code snippet, no finding" for code review)
  - Anti-Bias Battery with 5 self-checks (Devil's Advocate, Ego Check, Context Check, Best Intent, Pattern Recognition)
  - Based on Deep Verify methodology by [@LKrysik](https://github.com/LKrysik/BMAD-METHOD) 🎯
- Evidence Score extraction in `validation_metrics.py` with backward compatibility
- New regex patterns for Evidence Score report parsing
- `bmad-assist patch compile-all` command for batch compilation of all patches without valid cache
- Per-phase timeout configuration via `timeouts:` section in bmad-assist.yaml
- Antipatterns extraction from synthesis reports for organizational learning
- Source context support for validation workflows (story file, epic context)
- Auto-generate sprint-status.yaml from epic files when missing

### Fixed
- Python 3.14+ compatibility: `Traversable` import moved to `importlib.resources.abc` (thanks [@mattbrun](https://github.com/mattbrun))
- Clearer error messages for outdated/incompatible cache files
- Evidence Score calculation deduplication in code review reports
- `webhook-relay` experiment fixture repaired (other fixtures still broken)

### Changed
- `validate-story` workflow now uses Evidence Score instead of 1-10 severity
- `validate-story-synthesis` workflow updated for CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/MINOR terminology
- `code-review` workflow now uses Evidence Score with mandatory code snippet enforcement
- `code-review-synthesis` workflow updated for CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/MINOR terminology
- `ValidatorMetrics` dataclass extended with Evidence Score fields
- `AggregateMetrics` with auto-detection of report format (legacy vs Evidence Score)
- `format_deterministic_metrics_header()` dynamically switches output format
- Providers now accept any model format without hardcoded restrictions

## [0.4.5] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- Project setup consolidation - `init` and `run` now copy bundled workflows
- Batch overwrite prompt `[a/s/i/d/?]` when local workflows differ from bundled
- `--reset-workflows` flag for `init` command to restore bundled versions
- `warnings.suppress_gitignore` config option to silence gitignore warnings
- Exit code 2 for "success with warnings" (workflows skipped in CI)

### Changed
- `init` command refactored to use shared `ensure_project_setup()` logic
- `run` command now performs implicit project setup (without gitignore changes)
- File copy uses atomic write with rollback on partial failure

### Security
- Path traversal protection in workflow copying
- Symlinks not followed during file operations
- Temp files created with 0o644 permissions

## [0.4.4] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- OpenCode provider for Multi-LLM validation (subprocess-based, JSON streaming)
- Amp provider for Sourcegraph's Claude wrapper (smart mode only)
- Three-tier config hierarchy: Global → CWD → Project

### Fixed
- Config loading now respects CWD when using `--project` flag
- OpenCode provider accepts any `provider/model` format (no hardcoded list)

## [0.4.3] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- CLI `--phase` flag to override starting phase in development loop

### Changed
- Sprint reconciler with forward-only protection and improved entry ordering
- Retrospective entries now tracked in sprint-status.yaml

## [0.4.2] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- Bundled workflow templates for standalone package distribution
- External docs support - planning artifacts can live outside project root
- Configurable loop phases via `loop:` key in bmad-assist.yaml

### Changed
- Paths singleton pattern for consistent path resolution
- Project knowledge path added to CompilerContext

### Fixed
